# IEMdepth
Using spatial encoding model to reconstruct positions of stimuli in depth.

In this experiment, we presented subjects with stereoscopic sphere stimuli, composed of multicolored flickering dots. Stimuli were presented at various positions evenly spaced along the horizontal (left-right) spatial axis, and the depth (near-far) spatial axis. We used an inverted encoding model to reconstruct the locations of stimuli along each of these spatial axes.
